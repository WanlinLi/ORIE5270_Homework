A. What we covered? 

1. Amazon Web Services (AWS): AWS provides cloud computing platforms to customers.
1.1. Launch instance: 
a) Sign in personal account in AWS, go to Services > compute > EC2 > Launch instance;
b) Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), e.g. Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-0cf31d971a3ca20d6;
c) Choose an instance type, e.g. t2.micro > Review and Launch > Launch;
d) Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair > If choose to create a new key pair, download the key pair file key_name.pem > Launch;

1.2. Connect to host in Linux:
a) Change directory to where the key pair file is stored (using the cd command), e.g. cd /mnt/c/Users/16907/OneDrive/Documents/;
b) Connect: ssh -i “key_name.pem” user@public_DNS, then the current working directory changes from the personal laptop to the ec2 user instance;

1.3. Install Git: sudo yum install git;


2. Git and Linux
2.1. Generate a new SSH key:
a) ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C your_email@example.com
b) When prompted to “Enter a file in which to save the key”, directly press Enter to accepts the default file location;
c) Type and re-type the secure passphrase at the prompt.

2.2. Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent:
a) eval $(ssh-agent -s);
b) Add the SSH private key to the ssh-agent: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa;
c) Enter the passphrase for the private key.

2.3. Add the SSH key to the GitHub account:
a) Copy the SSH key to the clipboard: Go to the folder which contains the private key file using command “cd ~/.ssh”, then can see the list of file using “ls”, including the id_rsa.pub file. Open this file using command “vim id_rsa.pub”, and copy it to the clipboard;
b) In the upper-right corner of any GitHub page, click the profile photo > Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > New SSH Key or New GPG key > Add a title, and paste the key into the key field > Add SHH Key.

2.4. Branches:
a) Check the current branch: git branch;
b) Create a new branch: git checkout -b name_branch commit_number;
 
2.5. Git log/add/commit/push:
a) Create a new repository in GitHub, e.g. WanlinLi/test;
b) Git clone: git clone https://github.com/WanlinLi/test.git;
c) cd test/;
d) Create a new txt file: touch text.txt;
e) Git add: git add text.txt;
f) Git commit: git commit -m "message";
g) Git push: git push origin master.

2.6. Other useful Linux command:
a) Show current directory: pwd;
b) Formatted listing with all hidden file: ls -al;
c) Create a directory dir: mkdir dir; 
 
3. Useful VIM command:
a) Go to last line of the document > G;
b) Go to xxx line in the document > xxxG;
c) Copy xx (number of lines) lines > xxyy;
d) Write the file > :w;
e) Quit the file (do not save) > :q;
f) Write and exit the file > :wq;

4. Shell example script: 
bash middle.sh pentane.pdb 15 5: Select the first 15 rows of the file pentane.pdb, and output the last 5 rows of the selected part.


B. Why does that matter?
Cloud compute increase efficiency. It provides flexibility; if your computation needs vary from time to time, you can easily scale up or down your cloud capacity to match your needs, which also help to save the hardware cost.
Branches are useful because you can try out your new ideas by creating a new branch in your project and try out the ideas on that branch. Changes on the branches do not affect the master branch. 
Version control can be used to keep track of what one person did and when. It is like an unlimited "undo", and also allows many people to work in parallel.
Shell allows us to run a batch (e.g. a python script with some parameters as input) repeatedly.
